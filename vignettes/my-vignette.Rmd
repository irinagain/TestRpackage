# Introduction

This package implements soft-thresholding function, which is defined for any scalar $x$ and any non-negative number $a$ as 
$$
S(x, a) = sign(x)\max(|x|-a, 0).
$$
First, we will attach the package to access its functions.

```{r setup}
library(TestRpackage)
```

Next, we will apply function soft to $x=3$ at value $a=2$, which should return 1.
```{r example1, echo = FALSE}
soft(3, 2)
```
